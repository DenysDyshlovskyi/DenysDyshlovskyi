## 🎓 Currently working as an IT-intern at Renovasjons- og gjenvinningsetaten (REG)

* At free time I'm developing a game project with some friends, called Nocturnal Skirmish.
* As a side project, I'm making a password manager called Pass Manager Oasis (PMO).
* I've done a multitude of projects before, and I'll be glad to contribute to yours.
